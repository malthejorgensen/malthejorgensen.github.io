Having had trouble with both Dropbox and my external NTFS-formatted drive, I figured it was time for something new. Before switching to Copy, I would like to back up my stuff somewhere where I'm 99% my stuff won't suddenly go missing because of a bad sync. And so that I a "reference dataset" to check if anything has gone missing.

Since my external drive and it's unfortunate NTFS-formatting is also out of the question, the answer became cloud storage services. 

Contenders (from [alternativeto.net]) are:

- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Microsoft Azure Storage
